A partition is a subset of your input data which can be processed from other partitions. Therefor by applying multiple CPU's in parallel processing independent partitions a speed up of processing time can be achieved.  \r\n\r\nSome examples can be found [here](http://www.michaelslab.net/software/computing/index.html)\r\n\r\n## bb-examples\r\n\r\nThis example contains application examples for the beagle bone boards.\r\n\r\n## Huygens\r\nThe objective of this project was to find a reasonable tool set for presenting data graphically. During the cause of this project id some experiments with such tools. The results is being shown on the [project page](http://www.michaelslab.net/ci.php/huygens)   \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
