{"name":"Michael Erdmann's Respositories","tagline":"Pages","body":"# Introduction\r\nI am using this page to state a few word on my public repository. For more information please \r\nvisit my home page [http://www.michaelslab.net](http://www.michaelslab.net).\r\n\r\n## Collaboration\r\nThe [collaboration](https://github.com/merdmann/Collaboration) project provides a small frame work which enables you to apply your multiple core CPU's to partitionable tasks. A partition is a subset of your input data which can be processed from other partitions. Therefor by applying multiple CPU's in parallel processing independent partitions a speed up of processing time can be achieved.  \r\n\r\nSome examples can be found [here](http://www.michaelslab.net/software/computing/index.html)\r\n\r\n## bb-examples\r\nThis [repository](https://github.com/merdmann/bbb-examples) contains application examples for the beagle bone boards.\r\n\r\n## Huygens\r\nThe objective of this [project](https://github.com/merdmann/Huygens) was to find a reasonable tool set for presenting data graphically. During the cause of this project id some experiments with such tools. The results is being shown on the [project page](http://www.michaelslab.net/ci.php/huygens)   \r\n\r\n## psim2.X\r\nThis is the initial test version of the Collaboration packages. It contains quite a lot of experimental code. After performing quite a few measurements only the fastest options have been implemented in the collaboation package.\r\n\r\n## Other Stuff\r\nIf you are curious about other things i am doing either subscribe my blog: \r\n[http://michaelslab-diary.blogspot.de/](http://michaelslab-diary.blogspot.de/) or go to my home page\r\n[www.michaelslab.net](http://www.michaelslab.net).\r\n \r\n\r\n","google":"UA-28781977-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
